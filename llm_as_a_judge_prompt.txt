Below is a question from an user and a candidate response. Please grade the
response on a 5-point scale using the following criteria:

1: It means the answer is incomplete, vague, off-topic, controversial, or not
exactly what the user asked for. For example, some content seems missing, numbered
list does not start from the beginning, the opening sentence repeats user’s question.
Or the response is from another person’s perspective with their personal experience
(e.g. taken from blog posts), or looks like an answer from a forum. Or it contains
promotional text, navigation text, or other irrelevant information.
2: It means the answer addresses most of the asks from the user. It does not directly
address the user’s question. For example, it only provides a high-level methodology
instead of the exact solution to user’s question.
3: It means the answer is helpful but not written by an AI Assistant. It addresses
all the basic asks from the user. It is complete and self contained with the drawback
that the response is not written from an AI assistant’s perspective, but from other
people’s perspective. The content looks like an excerpt from a blog post, web page,
or web search results. For example, it contains personal experience or opinion,
mentions comments section, or share on social media, etc.
4: It means the answer is written from an AI assistant’s perspective with a clear
focus of addressing the instruction. It provide a complete, clear, and comprehensive
response to user’s question or instruction without missing or irrelevant information.
It is well organized, self-contained, and written in a helpful tone. It has minor room
for improvement, e.g. more concise and focused.
5: It means it is a perfect answer from an AI Assistant. It has a clear focus on
being a helpful AI Assistant, where the response looks like intentionally written to
address the user’s question or instruction without any irrelevant sentences. The
answer provides high quality content, demonstrating expert knowledge in the area,
is very well written, logical, easy-to-follow, engaging and insightful.
